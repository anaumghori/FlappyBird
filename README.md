# Flappy Bird Dueling DQN Agent
This project showcases a custom implementation of a Dueling Deep Q-Network (Dueling DQN) to train an agent that masters the game of Flappy Bird. Using advanced reinforcement learning techniques, the agent learns to navigate through challenging obstacles and improve its performance over thousands of episodes.  

## What Makes This Project Special?
- **Dueling DQN Architecture:** Enhances learning efficiency by separately estimating state values and action advantages.  
- **Replay Buffer:** Implements experience replay to stabilize training by reusing past experiences.  
- **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration:** Balances exploration and exploitation dynamically as training progresses.  
- **SmoothL1 Loss:** Ensures stability and robustness in optimization.  
- **Target Network Updates:** Uses soft updates to enhance learning stability.  

## Results

Results after around 13000 episodes (Training was stopped in middle)
